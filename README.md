# Basic Workflow: Bootstrap 4, Pug, Sass & Gulp

This is my personal Front-End Development boilerplate with Bootstrap 4 and Gulp to compile Pug and Sass files. 
It also includes Autoprefixer and Browser Sync.

It is by no means perfect. 
Soon I will add more features such as: SEO stuff, favicon, Windows icons, iOS icons, etc.

Just download, unzip it and install the dependencies using NPM, tweak the gulpfile if necessary.

### Any advice is welcome
